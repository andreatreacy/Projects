## Description
Program that uses Primâ€™s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph. It is considered to be a greedy algorithm. It starts at a chosen vertex and adds the edge with the smallest weight connected to the vertex to the minimum spanning tree. It then adds the edge with the next smallest weight connected to any vertex connected to an edge on the minimum spanning tree. If adding an edge will create a cycle the edge is not added. It continues to do this until all of the vertices are connected to the minimum spanning tree.
