## Note
This is my first ever programming project. The purpose of this project was to get aquainted with basic Java programming. I am aware that having a lot of static variables like this is not good, and that the code could be more efficient. I am currently working on a more efficient Object Oriented version of this project.

## Description
In this program the user chooses where they are travelling (Which line and zone) and what type of ticket they want (Adult/child, single/return). They then choose the quantity they want and then pay. The program calculates their change. If the terminal's float is too low to return change the transaction will be cancelled.
If the terminal's float is less than 5.00 or if it has no ticket paper left it will close.
There is also an Admin menu that can be activated by pressing a in the main menu. The admin can check stats about the terminal and the tickets it sold and top up the float and ticket paper.
