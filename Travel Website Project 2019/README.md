# Travel Website Project 2019

## Description
This website is for a travel agency that specialises in continental tours. There are four tours on offer (Europe, U.S.A., Asia, and Africa). Each tour has its own page featuring information about the tour, an embedded map that I will make on Google maps marking the stops on the tour, and an image carousel with pictures of some of the things you can see if you go on this tour. These image carousels are made using JavaScript. From these continent pages the user is able to click the book now button which will lead them to the booking form. The booking form will not submit until all the required fields are filled in correctly. JavaScript will validate the form and send an alert if something is wrong. It will also send an alert to say if the form submitted successfully.
There are six working webpages altogether (index.html, europe.html, usa.html, asia.html, africa.html, and booking.html). The rest of the links are dummy links.
This website is responsive to different screen sizes as I have used media queries to scale it to the right size for the screen.
